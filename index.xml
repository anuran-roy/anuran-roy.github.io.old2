      <description>Technical Blogs Art of Problem Solving This is my oldest blog, which is quite inactive now. But to be honest, this was the first blog that I worked on seriously. So many good memories abound&amp;hellip;
You can find a lot of math and CS content here. Even a series on ML simply explained. I use the pseudonym A-student there.

      <description>Who am I? Roy. Anuran Roy. (I like James Bond.) I&amp;rsquo;m a machine that converts coffee to code.
I am a freshmeat freshman at VIT Vellore. Thanks to the CoVid pandemic and the lockdown it gave us for free, I am still at home, not waiting to go to college.
In the meantime, I am trying to learn a few stuff (read Web Dev and Competitive Coding :P). This is one such (noobish) example of how much I have developed in web dev :P</description>

      <description>No more Sphinx The long-lived and long-loved CMU Sphinx, a brainchild of Carnegie Mellon University, is not maintained actively anymore, since 5 years. But does that mean that we need to move to more production-oriented solutions? No, we actually don&amp;rsquo;t. The team CMU Sphinx Project has slowly rolled in a new child project - Vosk.
Note that there are many other production-oriented solutions available (like OpenVINO, Mozilla DeepSpeech, etc.), which are equally as good, if not better at speech recognition.</description>
